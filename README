This is a simple mash-up between San Francisco film locations (SF OpenData) and Google Maps.
Built with Node.js, Angular, and Express, this is a classic MEAN stack application (sans database), 
in which users can input the titles of films shot in SF, and populate a map with markers representing
the locations where the film was shot.  

To run this, clone/download, then run
npm install
npm start
app will be running on localhost:3000

I've commented out config.js from the gitignore so you won't need an API key.

Bugs: 
-The largest inherent problem with this project stems from the unformatted data-set.  Some locations are actual addresses, or major landmarks (i.e. 'Coit Tower'), but others are rather vague ('skyline/exterior scenes') or blank, and do not return coordinates from the Google Places API.  The unformatted data often confuses the Google Places API... "Mason & California Streets (Nob Hill)", for instance, returns coordinates for Fort Mason.  "California & Grant Streets" returns coordinates just south of the SF ZOO. 

-The API allows for 1000 requests per day.  This can easily be exceeded (very easily while developing), as every location is a seperate request, and some films have 10+ locations listed. 




Thanks for taking the time to check this out!  Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
