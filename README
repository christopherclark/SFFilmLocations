DEPLOYED AT https://sffilmlocations.herokuapp.com/

This is a simple mash-up between San Francisco film locations (SF OpenData) and Google Maps.
Built with Node.js, Angular, and Express, this is a classic MEAN stack application (sans database), 
in which users can input the titles of films shot in SF, and populate a map with markers representing
the locations where the film was shot.  

Thanks for taking the time to check this out!  Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
